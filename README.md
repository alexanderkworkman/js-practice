# js-practice

## Purpose

This repository is for all the javascript practice I do while familiarizing myself with the language. None of this is an actual project, just a record of experimentation and getting comfortable coding.

## Files and Folders

- index.html
    - The empty webpage that opens in the browser to execute the JS code
- sandbox.js
    - My working JavaScript document where I'm currently experimenting
- experiments
    - The folder for all my past code experiments
